                    <p>
                        As a video-game enthusiast, I like to keep up with the latest news in virtual reality, for I believe that this will make the video game experience to a whole new level. Not only will virtual reality be beneficial to the gaming industry, but it also has the potential to positively impact many of the industries that require training, so that fewer resources are spent for that area.
                        I am very interested in the work being done by Neuralink and am excited for the advancements that it is making.

                    <p>Recently I have taken interest in automating repetitive tasks in my personal life. These projects have escalated and allowed me to automate the part of my house so that it is more efficient and overall more enjoyable.
